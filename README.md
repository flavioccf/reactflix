## 💡 About the project

> Project built in Alura's ReactJS week [Imersão React da Alura](https://www.alura.com.br/imersao-react/)
> The project's goal was to develop a YouTube playlist with a similar to Netflix front end.
> I've created the project as it should be and added a new branch with an integration with [Lomadee](https://www.lomadee.com) promotions API and instead of showing videos it shows a showcase of promotional offers
